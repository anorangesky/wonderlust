# Wonderlust - Explore the unexpected
![alt text](https://github.com/anorangesky/wonderlust/blob/master/src/images/wonderlust2.png?raw=true)

"We show you places Google Maps won't" 

## Project description
Find interesting unexpected attractions in your local area. We fetch articles from Wikipedia that are related to a location (long, lat) and display them on a map using Google Map API. The users will be able to explore attractions on the map either by drag-drop or searching for a location in the search bar. As logged-in users, they will also be able to share, save, and add attractions to the map (stored in Firebase). 

## Midterm update (what we have done so far)
- Project prototype in Figma
- Early user evaluation on the prototype and the project concept both on Mobile and Desktop
- Connect Google Map API
- Search bar 
- Support for fetching articles from Wikipedia (MediaWiki API)
- Details view connected to each location marker on the map  
- User auth using Google and Email (including user signup) through Firebase
- Wonderlust logotype (WL :) )
